        I’m a Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience, and a background in art and visual
        communication. I’ve worked in startups, as well as medium-sized and “Big 5” consultancies. Projects
        I've been a part of have been across finance, eCommerce, and media sectors.

      <p>
        My approach to software engineering involves doing sufficient up-front discovery of the problem
        space to provide a practical basis for making the right tooling and tech decisions.
